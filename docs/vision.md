*   **Educational Goals:** Meets capstone requirements, demonstrating proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AI-assisted development workflows.

## 5. Constraints
*   **Timeline:** Development must align with capstone milestones, with initial deliverables completed by early May 2025.
*   **Technology Stack:** Primarily HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end; backend features (e.g., payment processing) to be explored in later phases.
*   **Resource Limitations:** Relies on Figma for design assets, VS Code for development, and AI tools (e.g., Grok) for assistance, within the constraints of the TALA platform.

## 6. Assumptions
*   Figma designs provide comprehensive specifications for UI components, including colors, typography, and layouts.
*   AI tools are available to support coding, debugging, and optimization throughout the development process.
