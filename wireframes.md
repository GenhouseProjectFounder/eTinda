# Wireframes

## Key Considerations
*   **Simplicity:** Design clean layouts to facilitate easy navigation for all users.
*   **Mobile-First Design:** Optimize for smartphone screens, ensuring responsiveness across devices.
*   **Clear Calls-to-Action:** Include prominent buttons (e.g., “Save as Draft”) to guide user interactions.
*   **Intuitive Navigation:** Implement a collapsible sidebar for the seller dashboard to streamline access to sections.
*   **Readable Typography:** Use Inter and Open Sans fonts with appropriate sizes for accessibility across devices.
*   **Minimal Clutter:** Prioritize essential elements to maintain a focused user experience.
*   **Design Consistency:** Align with the visual style specified in the Figma design (e.g., color palette, typography).
*   **Logical Flow:** Ensure seamless paths for key actions, such as adding products, tracking orders, and viewing notifications.
