# Design Guidelines

## Typography
*   **Inter:** Utilize for headings, subheadings, and buttons to ensure legibility and a professional aesthetic.
*   **Open Sans:** Apply to body text, paragraphs, and captions for a breathable, open appearance.
*   Ensure high contrast between text and backgrounds (e.g., dark text on light backgrounds) for readability.
*   Maintain a minimum font size of 16px on mobile devices to enhance accessibility.

## Color Palette
Adopt a sustainable, eco-conscious color scheme aligned with eTinda’s brand identity:
*   `#A6D017` (Green): For primary actions (e.g., buttons, CTAs).
*   `#FF8463` (Orange): For highlights and alerts (e.g., notifications).
*   `#FEFCEF` (Cream): For backgrounds to create a clean, natural look.
*   `#3B3D32` (Dark Gray): For text to ensure contrast and readability.
*   Ensure all color combinations meet WCAG contrast requirements.
*   Align with the color specifications provided in the Figma design.

## UI Elements
*   Design large, tappable buttons (e.g., “Save as Draft”) with the primary color `#A6D017` for visibility.
*   Incorporate simple, recognizable icons (e.g., cart, edit) to enhance usability.
*   Minimize screen clutter by focusing on essential elements and maintaining clean layouts.

## Accessibility
*   Adhere to WCAG guidelines, including providing alt text for images and ensuring keyboard navigation support.
*   Include text descriptions for all visual elements to support screen readers.

## Language and Tone
*   Use simple, non-technical language to ensure accessibility for all users.
*   Maintain a friendly, professional tone that reflects eTinda’s commitment to sustainability and ethical commerce.

## Responsive (Mobile)
*   Responsive mobile design to ensure usability on small screens.
*   Implement responsive layouts using Flexbox and media queries to support desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Simplicity
*   Design interfaces that are clean and intuitive to reduce cognitive load.
*   Focus on user-friendly navigation to accommodate users with limited digital literacy.
